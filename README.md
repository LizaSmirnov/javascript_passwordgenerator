# javascript_passwordgenerator

## Description

- With Html and CSS provided, worked on Javasript to reach into the html and create a password generator
- An event listener was created when the person click on generate password.
- To continhe with the password generator, a person fisrt has to choose a valid number between 8 and 128. If not, the prompt will not co intue and will take them back.
- the password generator asks the person for their preferences: Whether they want to have any upper or lower case letters, any sepcial characters and any numbers
  indluded in their password
- Once a person has choosen their preferences, the password will be generated and will show above the button generate passwor in a box

## Installation
- Mostly workin on html first made sure the event listener was working correctly and redirect it to the first function I was going to use.

- After that I made some global variables to store my information as I build my function.

- I used a if/else function to make sure the person would always choose a number between 8 to 128 as the size of the password or it will start again.
